<h1>React, Javascript & HTML+CSS</h1>

<ul>
  <strong>Key points and notes:</strong>
  <li>Drag & drop simplicity of uploading pictures for the Interior page.</li>
  <li>Products' dropdown only displays available categories & the categories that the owner asked for.</li>
<li>The client asked that most pictures would remain uncompressed because it's a design oriented page and it is already fast.</li>
  <li>The client requested support for 2 languages and no more will be required in the future. The client also noted that products may have up to 3 photos only and to display manufacturers that do not currently offer any products.</li>

  <li>You can click on the product description text and you will be redirected to the Inquire page and the message will autofill to "Hello, I am interested in {the name of the product of which page you were on}"</li>
    <li>Some parts of the code are more complex than they should be because the initial plan was to make a more sophisticated website (more filters), but after making it the client thought it was overengineering and asked to remove it. Those 'complex' code parts are not removed because they might be used in the future if the client wants them.</li>  
  <li>Live (with some downtime for maintenance) since february 2021. No key issues have been noticed.</li>
  <li>Tested & working without any flaws on all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and Firefox Developer's Edition.</li>
</ul>
