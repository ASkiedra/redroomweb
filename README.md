<h1>React, Javascript & HTML + CSS</h1>

<ul>
  <h2><strong>Key points and notes:</strong></h2>
  <li>Drag & drop simplicity of uploading pictures for the Interior page.</li>
  <li>Products' dropdown only displays available categories & the categories that the owner asked for.</li>
  <li>You can click on the product description text and you will be redirected to the Inquire page and the message will autofill to "Hello, I am interested in {the name of the product of which page you were on}"</li>
  <li>The client requested support for 2 languages and no more will be required in the future. The client also noted that products may have up to 3 photos only and to display manufacturers that do not currently offer any products.</li>
  <li>The client asked that most pictures would remain uncompressed because it's a design oriented page and it's already fast.</li>
  <li>Live since February 2021. Tested & working without any flaws on all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and Firefox Developer's Edition.</li>
</ul>
